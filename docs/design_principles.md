Based on the structure and choices we've made so far for Codex AI, here are the key software design principles and patterns we are implicitly or explicitly incorporating:

1.  **Separation of Concerns (SoC):**
    
    -   **Frontend/Backend Split:** The most obvious separation. The React frontend handles the user interface and user experience, while the FastAPI backend handles business logic, data persistence, and AI interactions. They communicate via a well-defined API.
        
    -   **Layered Architecture (within Backend):** We are structuring the backend into distinct layers:
        
        -   **API Layer (app/api/):** Handles HTTP requests/responses, routing, data validation (via Pydantic/FastAPI). It knows what the user wants.
            
        -   **Service Layer (app/services/):** Contains the core business logic. It knows how to fulfill the request (e.g., orchestrate file operations, call RAG logic). This layer is called by the API layer.
            
        -   **Data Access/Utility Layer (Implicit - FileService, RAG module):** Handles the low-level details of interacting with external systems like the file system, vector database (via LlamaIndex), and external AI APIs (via LlamaIndex).
            
    -   **Modular Routers (FastAPI):** Breaking down API endpoints into separate files (projects.py, chapters.py, etc.) and using APIRouter improves organization within the API layer.
        
2.  **API-First Design:**
    
    -   We started by defining the data contracts (Pydantic models) and API endpoint signatures before implementing the full logic. This ensures a clear interface between the frontend and backend. FastAPI's automatic documentation generation reinforces this.
        
3.  **Dependency Injection (via FastAPI):**
    
    -   Although we haven't fully implemented it yet (e.g., the get_project_service placeholder), FastAPI is built around dependency injection. This allows us to easily provide dependencies (like service instances or database connections) to our endpoint functions, making the code more testable and decoupled.
        
4.  **Modularity and Extensibility (via LlamaIndex Abstractions):**
    
    -   By using LlamaIndex's LLM, VectorStore, and BaseEmbedding interfaces, we are designing the RAG component to be pluggable. We can swap out Gemini for OpenAI, or ChromaDB for Weaviate, by changing the configuration or implementing a different adapter, without rewriting the core service logic that uses these components. This is a form of the **Strategy Pattern** or **Adapter Pattern**.
        
5.  **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) (Applied to Modules/Files):**
    
    -   We aim for each module or file to have a single, well-defined responsibility. For example, projects.py handles project endpoints, project_service.py handles project business logic, FileService handles file operations. This makes the code easier to understand, modify, and test.
        
6.  **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) (Goal):**
    
    -   By creating reusable services (like FileService) and potentially utility functions (app/utils/), we aim to avoid duplicating common logic (like constructing file paths or reading/writing files) across different parts of the application. Pydantic models also help avoid redefining data structures.
        
7.  **Configuration Management:**
    
    -   Using .env files and a config.py with Pydantic's BaseSettings provides a structured way to manage application settings and secrets, separating configuration from code.
        
8.  **Clear Data Contracts (Pydantic):**
    
    -   Pydantic models (ProjectCreate, ProjectRead, etc.) define the expected structure and types of data for API requests and responses, providing automatic validation and clear documentation.
        

**Principles We Should Keep in Mind Going Forward:**

-   **Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS):** Especially as a solo developer, avoid over-engineering solutions initially. Start simple and refactor/add complexity only when necessary.
    
-   **Error Handling:** We haven't explicitly designed this yet, but proper error handling (using FastAPI's HTTPException, defining custom exceptions) will be crucial for a robust application.
    
-   **Testability:** While full TDD might be overkill for a solo project initially, designing with testability in mind (e.g., using dependency injection, keeping functions focused) will make adding tests later much easier.
    

Overall, we're building on standard practices for modern web application development, emphasizing separation, clear interfaces, and leveraging the features of our chosen frameworks (FastAPI, React, LlamaIndex) to promote maintainability and future growth.
